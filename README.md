## DX-BALL

        - DX-Ball is a computer game developed in Turbo C++ using graphics libraries.
        - Thoug developed in C++, It offers immersive user interface and reach features that only 
          animated games can offer.
        - It is easy to develop the same game and UI using game engine tool such as Unity-3D but 
          developing it in C++ is quite a challenging task due to lack of support for rich user 
          interface.
        - Most importantly, I have developed this game without borrowing even a single line of code 
          from any other source but my brain. 
        - Take a look at actual screenshots below, captured by executing source code using Turbo C++ 
          compiler.

####Features:
        - Rich user interface
        - Complete user controlled UI.
        - Lots of options for customizing Ball and Slidebar colors and size.
        - Multiple difficulty levels: Beginners, Intermediate & Expert.
        - Multiple game rounds.
